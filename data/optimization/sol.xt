we chane:
config
trend filter layer 2 disable
equity curve print disable
while doing layer 1 kalman keep slope and r2 0 and window 5 


first one was only kalman 
     "kalman": {
        "process_noise": 0.01,
        "measurement_noise": 4.0,
        "filter_order": 3
      }
this ran fine on the training period but actually lost on the testing period
